# SMM MVC Modernization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for modernizing the SMM (Sosyal Medya YÃ¶netimi) portal's MVC architecture.

## Current State Analysis
- Legacy MVC implementation
- Performance bottlenecks identified
- Security concerns documented
- Scalability limitations

## Modernization Goals
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement async/await patterns
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching strategies

2. **Security Enhancement**
   - Update authentication mechanisms
   - Implement OWASP security standards
   - Add input validation

3. **Scalability Improvements**
   - Microservices architecture considerations
   - Load balancing implementation
   - Database optimization

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Code analysis and dependency audit
- [ ] Testing framework setup
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline establishment

### Phase 2: Core Modernization (Weeks 3-6)
- [ ] Controller refactoring
- [ ] Model optimization
- [ ] View layer improvements

### Phase 3: Testing & Deployment (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Production deployment

## Success Metrics
- Response time improvement: Target 50% reduction
- Code coverage: Minimum 80%
- Security scan: Zero critical vulnerabilities

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Data migration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backup and rollback strategy
- **Risk**: User experience disruption
  - **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout with feature flags

## Review Schedule
- Weekly progress reviews
- Bi-weekly stakeholder updates
- Final review before production deployment
